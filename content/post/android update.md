**Heads-Up for Future Games**

Google plans to block apps from unverified developers. As an independent developer who values **freedom and privacy**, I may choose **not** to get verified.

This could trigger installation warnings, but my games are safe to install and play. Iâ€™m committed to keeping them **accessible, free, and private**.
